# __TEAMNAME__ In-class Machine Translation Shared Task 2017 Submission
This repository is a result of our participation in the shared task. 
We went through the process of building, analyzing, and improving the neural machine translation system.

The shared task was for Estonian-English language pair. 
It included working with ~19.000.000 sentence pairs.

Sections below summarize key milestones we went through.  

##  Baseline system
- Our baseline system was __Concrete one-sentence summary of the baseline system.__
- As a result, we got __YOUR_BLEU_ON_ACCURAT(!!!)DEV_SET__ BLEU points on the shared dev set.

More details: [__REPORT_1_LINK__]. // use format [link](url)

## Baseline manual evaluation
- We manually analyzed __40_OR_60__ baseline translations. 
- Or main observation was that __Concrete one-sentence description of the problem you found and tried to fix later.__ // _put here only the problem(s) you actually put the most effort to_
- Take a look at our the motivating example produced by baseline system:
"__relevant_sentence_from_report_2__"

## Final system
- In order to address translation issues found after our manual evaluation we __descrie_the_modification_you_actually_included_in_your_final_system__. 
- The trained system gave us __YOUR_BLEU_ON_ACCURAT(!!!)DEV_SET__ BLEU points on the shared dev set that means __SMALL/BIG/ZERO INCREASE__ over the baseline.

## Final system manual evaluation
- Generally speaking, ____Just_your_general_feeling_about_the_translations_comparing_to_the_baseline (just a few words: got better, worse, same, etc; what about fluency).__
- Lets now look at how does our Motivating example looks like with our final system:
""__the_same_sentence_as_before_but_translated_with_your_final_system__", 
- As a result you can see that __some_words_about_the_sentence_comparing_to_its_baseline_translation__

## What we also tried or wanted to try
__describe_what_you_succesfully_tried_but_did_not_include_in_the_final_system_for_any_(technical_/_other_reason)__, __include_concrete_bleu_results/manual_evaluation_results_if_you_have_any_them_(one_sentece_here_or_leave_it_empty)__
__lastly,_describe_what_you_wnated_to_try_but_did_not_try_for_any_(technical_/_other_reason)__


## Final words
- __1st_sentence:your_results_on_the_test_set_and_interpretation_(feel_later)__
- __2nd_sentence:what_were_the_general_difficulties__
- __3rd_sentence:what_you_have_learnt__
