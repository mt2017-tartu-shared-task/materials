the purpose of this report is to describe the steps how Human Resource Management function should be built up – to clarify the strategy and actions of HRM-plan .
at present the Investment department has no HRM function .
the aim of this report was formulated with Head of EUPCU Dace Roze in discussion on the 22nd of September .
the contents of the HRM plan were still discussed with other heads of units : Anita Bisofa , Valda Cepurite and Valdis Bisters .
the Investment Department of Moe is growing rapidly and facing many changes at present and during the coming next years .
the possible changes of the department organisation are just now under consideration .
the pressure to handle the working processes as well as staff questions in an effective and correct way is urgent .
at present situation the directors and heads of units have so heavy workloads with projects that they hardly have time to develop HRM .
to appoint a person responsible of HRM is highly recommended , so that she / he could concentrate to create a HR – management system and to be able to develop it according to practical needs in the future .
before planning the HRM of the Investment department , the vision and mission of the department have to be clear .
it is recommendable to review the strategy and short term action plan of the Investment department yearly .
involvements in EU programmes as well as in national programmes should be emphasised according to actual needs .
the number of projects is increasing notably and the projects are turning more to implementing phase , which impacts to the number of staff needed and their competence areas .
Pim ( Project implementation Manual ) and POG ( Project Organization Guide ) are under finalising .
they should be in use during this autumn .
when producing Pim different requirements of each funding method must be taken into account , relevant sub processes should be described .
these guides will give practical instructions to the work flow as well as to the organisation .
these guides should be good basis for the next steps like writing job descriptions and determining competence areas .
the actions needed when creating a HR – management system and when developing it according to practical needs in the future are described in a work flow in Annex III .
the preliminary schedule for creating HRM-system is shown in Annex IV .
as background for the schedule is assumed that in the beginning of December 2003 the HR-Manager / Coordinator could start on full time basis to work on developing the HRM .
the director of the department and the heads of units should work in close co-operation with the HRM-person by forwarding and prioritising the needs for continuous development .
they are also responsible for the developmental appraisal and PLP discussion , the HRM person contributes the discussions by up dating templates and by keeping data files .
an active role is needed from the heads of units also when determining the topics and contents for competence areas .
when making the self assessment of competences the whole staff is involved .
the HRM person coordinates the competence assessment and keeps the data files .
to the 2004 budget estimate of the department must be included both the HRM-development costs ( mainly labour costs of HRM person , heads of units , IT-person ) and implementing costs of training .
implementing costs consists of out-of-pocket costs ( e.g. courses , lecturers , material ) , own time for coaching and training , working time of the participants in training and arranging and facilitating the training by HRM person .
yearly costs arise also from the appraisal and PLP discussion in the form of lost working time .
a rough estimate of training efforts for year 2004 should be done before giving any budget figures .

in keeping with an appeal at the March 2005 meeting of the Council , Latvia has prepared the National Lisbon Programme for 2005-2008 ( hereinafter the “ Programme ” ) , aimed at the promotion of national growth and employment .
the Programme is a policy planning document which shows how , in 2005-2008 Latvia will reach the Lisbon strategy goals on the basis of the Integrated guidelines , approved by the Council in July 2005 .
the Programme reflects the most essential problems for Latvia to achieve the Lisbon strategy goals , indicating the main lines of action and activities to solve these problems , as well as performance indicators for achieving the goals .
the Programme is based on policy planning documents approved by the Republic of Latvia .
co-ordination for developing the Programme was provided by the Supervisory Board of the Lisbon Strategy .
consultations with the Saeima ( the Latvian Parliament ) and social partners were held .
the Programme consists of an introduction , main part ( macroeconomic policy , microeconomic reforms , employment policy guidelines ) and annexes .
all numerical information and data , except in cases specifically indicated , were received from the Central Statistical Bureau of the Republic of Latvia or from Eurostat .
in order to fulfil these goals successfully , the development of strategic plans is being implemented by the ministries , envisaging the preparation of the 2007 budget to be based on strategic planning principles . in accordance with the priorities set by the government , the action strategy of institutions defines medium-term development goals and directions , as well as all the corresponding programmes and sub-programmes of the particular ministry related to these goals and directions including their funding .
to ensure successful accession of Latvia to the Euro zone :
on July 21 , 2005 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted decision to establish governmental Committee for the Introduction of the European Union Single Currency in Latvia , which has the task of working out the plan of necessary measures in order to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the Euro zone .
on December 31 , 2004 the central government debt reached LVL 975 million or 13.3 % of GDP .
it is expected that the central government debt will continue to increase gradually in the following years and may reach 13.6 % of GDP in 2008 .
the level of the general government debt in Latvia is among the lowest in the European Union and is expected to remain considerably below the gross government debt volume criterion in the medium-term ( 60 % of GDP ) as defined in the Maastricht Treaty .
on the basis of the outlined information , it is not urgent to work out a particular scheme for the reduction of the government debt in the present situation of Latvia but , before any action in the area of central government debt management , a careful analysis of potential risks must be carried out in order to ensure execution of the most favourable transactions for the state .
main planned measures for 2005-2008 in the area of government debt policy ( guideline 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary financial resources for financing the government budget deficit and refinancing the central government debt liabilities at costs as low as possible and under conditions as favourable as possible , limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of Latvian state capital market and all financial systems ( responsible institution : Ministry of Finance ) :
– By working out new debt repurchase and debt exchange programmes for the management of debt refinancing risks , in order to use the opportunities offered by capital markets to attract low-cost long-term resources ;
– By continuing the started reduction of external government debt servicing costs , all existing provisions of foreign loan contracts will be evaluated , in order to assess the opportunities and existing restrictions on the anticipated repayment of several loans in the future by refinancing these loans with other more favourable loans , or on possible changes in loan contract provisions .
sustainability of Latvian public finances can be evaluated positively and is characterised by a relatively low level of the government debt , as well as adequate fiscal discipline .
Latvia &apos;s commitment to fulfil the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact , as well as the goal to join the Euro area is another additional guarantee for steadiness of the positive trends , relating to the existing fiscal position .
from the long-term perspective , sustainability of public finances will be mostly affected by the population &apos;s ageing process , resulting in a decreased number and proportion of able-bodied people and in increased demographic load .
initial calculations of financial sustainability show that the population &apos;s ageing will have an impact on Latvian society , national economy and public finances , but , due to the effected pension reform , this impact will not create insurmountable consequences .
the low level of Latvia &apos;s government debt and growing expenditure pressure also provides certain flexibility for the government , preserving stability of public finances .
however , it has to be noted that the population ageing creates new challenges for the health- care system .
breakdown of healthcare expenditure by age groups clearly shows that the higher costs fall on older people , whose number will significantly increase within the next 50 years .
long-term care expenditures in Latvia are currently quite low , determined both by the limited central and local government resources to be spent for this purpose , as well as the traditions and values of the society .
at the same time , health of other demographic groups has to be ensured as well , because the overall sickness rate is high .
the government is formulating an efficient healthcare system based on a long-term perspective .
changes in public finance policy will be required in the future to adjust the budget for a substantially different demographic situation .
as the demographic load will increase in the more distant future , GDP growth based on growing labour productivity will play a decisive role in the rise of the living standard of all population groups .
therefore it is important to ensure training of Latvia &apos;s main resource – human resources – in accordance with labour market requirements , to create an inclusive labour market ( see Section 3 ) .
forest substantially contributes to the overall development of Latvia &apos;s national economy , as it meets the requirements of raw materials for timber processing , which is one of the largest export sectors of Latvian industry .
forest is also an important resource for development of the countryside because it provides subsistence to local inhabitants working in various fields of action , for about 150 thousand forest owners and forest-related enterprises .
part of the profit gained in final felling , thinning or services is invested by a forest owner into conservation of forest value or implementation of continuous production .
the biggest forest owners ( state , local governments and some private forestry companies , owning thousands of hectares of forest areas ) can ensure a continuous process of production throughout the long forest management cycle .
in small forest properties , taking into account the composition of tree species , age , structure , former management practices , the economic situation in the countryside as well as the knowledge of forest owners , the practice of continuous forestry production is noticeably hindered .
due to the above-mentioned circumstances , at present an insufficient amount of investment ( profit ) is channelled into reproduction of forest value in the private forestry , therefore it is necessary to promote the rise of forest stands &apos; productivity ( timely and high-quality renewal of forest , use of selected forest reproductive material in renewal of forest , tending of young forest stands etc . ) , especially in private forests .
although waste management systems in Latvia have been improved , and society &apos;s awareness of the necessity to reduce waste increases , the volume of generated waste continues to rise every year .
opportunities for waste processing and utilisation are insufficient , although enterprises receive subsidies , through tender from the Latvian Environmental Protection Fund for the collection and utilisation of residue from environmentally harmful goods and products .
infrastructure of water management ( water supply and sewage collection and treatment ) is insufficiently developed and outdated , its capacity is not justified economically , technologies utilized are energy-intensive and do not comply with all environmental requirements .
this restricts business development , especially in the periphery of the country .
accessibility to water management infrastructure very noticeably affects the development of the public utilities sphere , public catering , healthcare and the tourism industry .
Latvia must set a deadline to transpose Internal Market directives as well as ensure the supervision and co-ordination of directives &apos; transposition at the public administration level and political level .
as of September 7 , 2005 , Latvia had not announced transposition of 1.3 % of EU directives ( or 0.5 % of the total number of directives ) .
taking into account that 99.5 % of directives were transposed into the normative acts of Latvia as of September 7 , 2005 , this fully ensures meeting the Lisbon goal of Transposing at least 98.5 % of directives , or to allow a transposition deficit for directives to the amount of 1.5 % .
transposition of Internal Market directives and implementation of the relevant legal acts directly depends on establishing a common system for supervising the transposition of EU legal acts .
at present , no efficient comprehensive data base for the supervising the transposition of EU legal acts has been established , which would provide an opportunity to follow up the directives &apos; transposition process at several reference points in due time , hence , beside other circumstances , the process of directives &apos; transposition slows down and the creation of a normative base of the EU Internal Market is encumbered .
limited human resources of public administration institutions reduce their ability for a qualitatively and timely controlled compliance of EU directives &apos; transposition process with the Latvian legal system .
restrictions to the EU Internal Market freedoms were largely eliminated before Latvia &apos;s accession to the EU , however , obstacles to cross-border transactions continue to exist .
essential hindrances are created by the existing requirements for business licensing and cumbersome administrative procedures , which require additional financial and time resources from entrepreneurs and affect most negatively the small and medium-sized enterprises .
thus it is necessary to analyze the validity and compliance with EU requirements of separate existing systems of licensing and other restrictions , including the requirements and validity of the current restrictions for the liberal professions ( lawyers , notaries , accountants , architects , engineers and pharmacists ) , in order to promote competitiveness in these sectors .
to implement a single and harmonised competition policy , in 2004 the Latvian normative acts of competition were harmonised in compliance with the requirements of the EU competition standards .
in case of cross-border jeopardy of competition or for prevention of potential competition distortions , the Latvian competition protection body – the Competition Council – has started active co-operation with the European Commission and competition protection bodies of EU Member States .
the electricity market is being opened gradually .
as of July 1 , 2004 the threshold for eligibility of a legal entity to the status of a qualified eligible customer was set at the 0.0 GWh .
thereby at present only households are not allowed to choose the supplier , and the electricity market opening is ensured up to 75 % .
none of the eligible customers has changed suppliers of electricity up to now .
in order to activate competition and encourage entry of alternative suppliers in the market , it is necessary to separate legally and functionally electricity transmission and distribution functions from the electricity production and sale functions .
conditions for the electric power supply structure are defined in the Electricity Market Law .
using only 1 % of its overall wealth each year , the EU is building our common future and assuming global responsibilities .
the focus of spending decisions is on meeting the challenges of the modern world to our society in the interests of a better life for the citizens of the EU .
the European Parliament is the only directly-elected body of the European Union . the 736 Members of the European Parliament are there to represent you , the citizen . they are elected once every five years by voters right across the 27 Member States of the European Union on behalf of its 500 million citizens .
in this part of our website , you can find information on how the Parliament organises its work , through a system of specialised committees . the work of the European Parliament is important because in many policy areas , decisions on new European laws are made jointly by Parliament and the Council of Ministers , which represents Member States .
Parliament plays an active role in drafting legislation which has an impact on the daily lives of its citizens : for example , on environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport , and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods . Parliament also has joint power with the Council over the annual budget of the European Union .
the European Parliament is made up of 736 Members elected in the 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union .
since 1979 MEPs have been elected by direct universal suffrage for a five-year period .
each Member State decides on the form its election will take , but follows identical democratic groundrules : equality of the sexes and a secret ballot .
in all Member States , the voting age is 18 , with the exception of Austria , where it is 16 .
European elections are already governed by a number of common principles : direct universal suffrage , proportional representation and a five-year renewable term .
the seats are , as a general rule , shared out proportionately to the population of each Member State .
each Member State has a set number of seats , the maximum being 99 and the minimum five .
equality of men and women : the proportion of women in the European Parliament has risen steadily .
at present slightly over one third of MEPs are women .
MEPs divide their time between Brussels , Strasbourg and their constituencies . in Brussels they attend meetings of the parliamentary committees and political groups , and additional plenary sittings . in Strasbourg they attend 12 plenary sittings .
in parallel with these activities they must also , of course , devote time to their constituencies .
the Members of the European Parliament are grouped by political affinity and not by nationality .
they exercise their mandate in an independent fashion .
members of the European Parliament , whose powers have become more and more extensive , influence every area of the day to day life of the European public : the environment , consumer protection and transport , as well as education , culture , health etc .
the new Statute for Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 . the new Statute makes the terms and conditions of MEPs &apos; work more transparent and introduces a common salary for all Members paid from the EU budget .
in the European Parliament , all Community languages are equally important : all parliamentary documents are published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and every MEP has the right to speak in the official language of his / her choice .
what better way to guarantee the transparency and accessibility of Parliament &apos;s work for all members of the general public .
firmly rooted in the European treaties , multilingualism is the reflection of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes the European institutions more accessible and transparent for the general public , which constitutes a guarantee for the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament differs from the other EU institutions through its obligation to ensure the highest possible degree of multilingualism .
all EU citizens must be able to refer to legislation directly concerning them in the language of their country .
furthermore , since every European citizen has the right to stand for election to the European Parliament , it is unreasonable to require Members to have a perfect command of one of the common languages .
the right of each Member to read parliamentary documents , to follow debates and to speak in his / her own language is expressly recognised in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , in its role as legislator the European Parliament is obliged to guarantee that the linguistic quality of all the laws which it adopts is beyond reproach in all official languages .
the Treaty provisions also allow all European citizens to follow Parliament &apos;s work , to ask questions and to receive replies in their own language .
the European Parliament , in its resolution of 9 October , declared that “ the experience gained from past European elections and referendums suggests that those who are aware of , and interested in , EU issues are more likely to participate , while those who are not as well informed are less likely to do so ” .
on the eve of the European Elections 2009 , Parliament , Council and Commission approved in October this year a Joint Declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership to stress that communicating on the European Union requires the political commitment of EU Institutions and Member States at all levels .
the main aim of the Joint Declaration is to give citizens access to fair and diverse information about the EU to enable them to actively participate in the public debate on European Union issues .
with this Joint Declaration , the EU Institutions committed themselves to addressing the communication challenge on EU issues in partnership with the Member States to ensure communication with the widest possible audience at the appropriate level .
in doing so , they expressed the intention to develop synergies with national , regional and local authorities as well as with representatives of civil society .
although each Member State and each Institution is responsible for its own communication strategy and priorities , Parliament , Council and Commission agreed to jointly identify a limited number of common communication priorities for each year .
finally , the Commission is invited to report back at the beginning of each year to the other EU Institutions on the main achievements of the implementation of the common communication priorities of the previous year .
the European Union is set up with the aim of ending the frequent and bloody wars between neighbours , which culminated in the Second World War .
as of 1950 , the European Coal and Steel Community begins to unite European countries economically and politically in order to secure lasting peace .
the six founders are Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Luxembourg and the Netherlands .
the 1950s are dominated by a cold war between east and west .
protests in Hungary against the Communist regime are put down by Soviet tanks in 1956 ; while the following year , 1957 , the Soviet Union takes the lead in the space race , when it launches the first man-made space satellite , Sputnik 1 .
also in 1957 , the Treaty of Rome creates the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , or ‘ Common Market ’ .
the 1960s sees the emergence of ‘ youth culture ’ , with groups such as The Beatles attracting huge crowds of teenage fans wherever they appear , helping to stimulate a cultural revolution and widening the generation gap .
it is a good period for the economy , helped by the fact that EU countries stop charging custom duties when they trade with each other .
they also agree joint control over food production , so that everybody now has enough to eat - and soon there is even surplus agricultural produce .
may 1968 becomes famous for student riots in Paris , and many changes in society and behaviour become associated with the so-called ‘ 68 generation ’ .
Denmark , Ireland and the United Kingdom join the European Union on 1 January 1973 , raising the number of member states to nine .
the short , yet brutal , Arab-Israeli war of October 1973 result in an energy crisis and economic problems in Europe .
the last right-wing dictatorships in Europe come to an end with the overthrow of the Salazar regime in Portugal in 1974 and the death of General Franco of Spain in 1975 .
the EU regional policy starts to transfer huge sums to create jobs and infrastructure in poorer areas .
the European Parliament increases its influence in EU affairs and in 1979 all citizens can , for the first time , elect their members directly .
the Polish trade union , Solidarność , and its leader Lech Walesa , become household names across Europe and the world following the Gdansk shipyard strikes in the summer of 1980 .
in 1981 , Greece becomes the 10th member of the EU and Spain and Portugal follow five years later .
in 1987 the Single European Act is signed .
this is a treaty which provides the basis for a vast six-year programme aimed at sorting out the problems with the free-flow of trade across EU borders and thus creates the ‘ Single Market ’ .
there is major political upheaval when , on 9 November 1989 , the Berlin Wall is pulled down and the border between East and West Germany is opened for the first time in 28 years .
with the collapse of communism across central and eastern Europe , Europeans become closer neighbours .
in 1993 the Single Market is completed with the the &apos; four freedoms &apos; of : movement of goods , services , people and money .
the 1990s is also the decade of two treaties , the ‘ Maastricht ’ Treaty on European Union in 1993 and the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999 .
people are concerned about how to protect the environment and also how Europeans can act together when it comes to security and defence matters .
in 1995 the EU gains three more new members , Austria , Finland and Sweden .
a small village in Luxembourg gives its name to the ‘ Schengen ’ agreements that gradually allow people to travel without having their passports checked at the borders .
millions of young people study in other countries with EU support .
communication is made easier as more and more people start using mobile phones and the internet .
the euro is the new currency for many Europeans .
the political divisions between east and west Europe are finally declared healed when no fewer than 10 new countries join the EU in 2004 .
many people think that it is time for Europe to have a constitution but what sort of constitution is by no means easy to agree , so the debate on the future of Europe rages on .
the single currency , the euro , allows you to compare prices directly in all the countries that use it .
travel between euro countries is easier because the costs and inconvenience of changing money have disappeared .
competition introduced by the frontier-free single market has driven quality up and prices down .
phone calls , Internet access and air travel are cheaper .
as consumers , EU rules protect you from faulty or substandard products whether you buy locally or in another country .
the EU also sets the highest standards for food safety .
EU citizens can live , work , study and retire in another EU country .
temporary restrictions for workers from the 12 newest member states are gradually being removed .
more than two million young people have already used EU programmes to study or train in another European country .
as a result , the EU schemes for educational exchanges and trans-border partnerships like Erasmus and Leonardo are bywords among students and other learners .
the EU does not decide what you learn in school , but it does work to ensure that your educational and professional qualifications are properly recognised in other EU countries .
a healthy environment is a big issue for Europeans and their governments .
this is why the EU is spearheading world efforts to protect the environment and fight climate change .
as pollution knows no borders , EU member states have taken joint action in many areas .
it is not surprising then that Europe &apos;s rivers and beaches are cleaner , vehicles pollute less , and there are strict rules for waste disposal .
dangerous waste from Europe can no longer be dumped in poor countries .
there are also tough EU rules to ensure that chemicals used by companies are safe for people and the environment .
the EU wants key activities like transport , industry , agriculture and tourism to be organised in such a way that they can be developed without destroying our natural resources — in short ‘ sustainable development ’ .
in an effort to put an end to climate change , EU leaders have agreed on tough measures to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 20 % by 2020 .
energy represents the cornerstone of the EU &apos;s long-term climate change policy and the EU has set binding targets to increase the use of clean , renewable energy sources such as wind , Hydropower or solar energy .
this will not only help fight climate change , but will also boost the economy and ensure a more stable supply of energy , making Europe less reliant on foreign oil and gas imports .
the EU has already put into place an innovative ‘ emission trading scheme ’ , whereby energy-intensive companies which cut their emissions are rewarded and those who exceed the given limits are penalised .
the euro ( € ) is probably the EU &apos;s most tangible achievement .
the single currency is shared by 16 countries ( 2009 ) , representing over two thirds of the EU population .
others will follow once their economies are ready .
all euro notes and coins can be used in the countries where the euro is accepted .
each note is the same , while the coins have a common design on one side and a national emblem of their country of origin on the other side .
these EU countries use the euro : Austria , Belgium , Cyprus , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Malta , the Netherlands , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia and Spain .
our society is fairer and more efficient when we do not discriminate against fellow human beings because of their nationality , gender , handicap , race or other factors .
that is why EU law bans discrimination .
as long ago as the 1950s , the first EU treaties contained a clear-cut rule that men and women must have equal pay for equal work .
this has given the EU a pioneering role in the fight for women &apos;s rights , which are now an integral part of all EU policies .
to tackle cross-border crime and terrorism , EU countries have taken steps to ensure full cooperation between their police and customs officers , immigration services and law courts .
one practical step has been to introduce a European arrest warrant , to make it easier to transfer suspected criminals from the country where they have been arrested to the country where they are wanted for questioning or to stand trial .
EU countries are also coordinating asylum policies and tightening controls at the EU &apos;s external frontiers .
since EU citizens are free to live in any member country , they must have equal access to justice everywhere in the EU .
member governments have to ensure that they all apply EU laws in the same way , and that court rulings in one country can be enforced in another .
the EU has done a lot to make it easier to solve cross-border legal problems involving marriage , separation , divorce and the custody of children , as well as other kinds of civil disputes .
new skills are needed too , and we must all spend more time learning throughout our lives .
more information on employment and growth in the EU .

he was not his father &apos;s only son , though he was the elder ; his brother , William , was a sawyer with his own business down along the St. Philip &apos;s bank of the Avon near Cuckold &apos;s Pill and the glasshouses , and he had three sisters all satisfactorily married to Free Men .
there were nests of Morgans in several parts of the city , but the Morgans of Richard &apos;s clan -- perhaps emigrants from Wales in long ago times -- had been resident for enough generations to have gained some standing ; indeed , clan luminaries like Cousin James-the-druggist headed significant enterprises , belonged to the Merchant Venturers and the Corporation , gave hefty donations to the poorhouses , and hoped one day to be Mayor .
Richard &apos;s father was not a clan luminary . nor was he a clan disgrace .
after some elementary schooling he had served his time as an apprentice victualler , then , certificated and a Free Man who had paid his fine , he struggled toward the goal of keeping his own tavern .
a socially acceptable marriage had been arranged for him ; Margaret Biggs came from good farming stock near Bedminster and enjoyed the cachet of being able to read , though she could not write .
the children , commencing with a girl , came along at intervals too frequent to render the grief of losing an occasional child truly unbearable .
when Dick learned sufficient control to withdraw before ejaculating , the children ceased at two living sons , three living daughters .
a good brood , small enough to make providing for them feasible .
dick wanted at least one fully literate son , and centered his hopes on Richard when it became apparent that William , two years younger , was no scholar .
so when Richard turned seven he was enrolled at Colston &apos;s School for Boys and donned the famous blue coat which informed Bristolians that his father was poor but respectable , staunchly Church of England .
and over the course of the next five years literacy and numeracy were drummed into him .
he learned to write a fair hand , do sums in his head , plod through Caesar &apos;s Gallic War , Cicero &apos;s speeches , and Ovid &apos;s Metamorphoses , stimulated by the acid sting of the cane and the caustic bite of the master &apos;s comments .
since he was a good though not shining scholar and owned into the bargain a quiet attractiveness , he survived the late Mr. Colston &apos;s philanthropic institution better than most , and got more out of it .
at twelve , it was time to leave and espouse a trade or craft in keeping with his education .
much to the surprise of his relations , he went in a different direction than any Morgan thus far .
among his chief assets was a talent for things mechanical , for putting together the pieces of a puzzle ; and allied to that was a patience truly remarkable in one so young .
of his own choice , he was apprenticed to Senhor Tomas Habitas the gunsmith .
this decision secretly pleased his father , who liked the idea of the Morgans &apos; producing an artisan rather than a tradesman .
besides which , war was a part of life , and guns a part of war .
a man who could make and mend them was unlikely to become cannon fodder on a battlefield .
for Richard , the seven years of his apprenticeship were a joy when it came to the work and the learning , even if a trifle on the cheerless side when it came to physical comfort .
like all apprentices , he was not paid , lived in his master &apos;s house , waited on him at his table , dined off the scraps , and slept on the floor .
luckily Senhor Tomas Habitas was a kind master and a superb gunsmith .
though he could make gorgeous dueling pistols and sporting guns , he was shrewd enough to realize that in order to prosper in those areas he must needs be a Manton , and a Manton he could not be outside of London .
so he had settled for making the military musket known affectionately to every soldier and marine as “ Brown Bess , ” all 46 inches of her -- be they wood of stock or steel of barrel -- brown as a nut .
at nineteen Richard was certificated and moved out of the Habitas household , though not out of the Habitas workshop .
there he continued , a master craftsman now , to make Brown Bess .
and he married , something he was not allowed to do while an apprentice .
his wife was the child of his mother &apos;s brother and therefore his own first cousin , but as the Church of England had no objection to that , he wed his bride in St. James &apos;s church under the auspices of Cousin James-of-the-clergy .
though arranged , it had been a love match , and the couple had only fallen more deeply in love as the years rolled on .
not without some difficulties of nomenclature , for Richard Morgan , son of Richard Morgan and Margaret Biggs , had taken another Margaret Biggs to wife .
while the Habitas gunsmithy had thrived that had not been so awkward , for the young pair lived in a two-roomed rented apartment on Temple Street across the Avon , just around the corner from the Habitas workshop and the Jewish synagogue .
the marriage had taken place in 1767 , three years after the Seven Years &apos; War against France had been concluded by an unpopular peace ; heavily in debt despite victory , England had to increase her revenues by additional taxes and decrease the cost of her army and navy by massive retrenchments .
guns were no longer necessary . so one by one the Habitas artisans and apprentices disappeared until the establishment consisted of Richard and Senhor Tomas Habitas himself .
then finally , just after the birth of little Mary in 1770 , Habitas was reluctantly obliged to let Richard go .
“ Come and work for me , ” Dick Morgan had said cordially .
“ Guns may come and go , but rum is absolutely eternal . ”
it had answered very well , despite the problem with names .
Richard &apos;s mother had always been known as Mag and Richard &apos;s wife as Peg , two diminutives for Margaret .
the real trouble was that save for quirky Protestant Dissenters who christened their male progeny “ Cranfield ” or “ Onesiphorus , ” almost every male in England was John , William , Henry , Richard , James or Thomas , and almost every female was Ann , Catherine , Margaret , Elizabeth or Mary .
one of the few customs which embraced every class from highest to lowest .
“ I &apos;ve never seen anything like it before ! ”
the words came from a dry suited diver who had just surfaced behind the stern of the research vessel , his voice breathless with excitement .
after swimming over to the ladder , he removed his fins and mask and passed them up to the waiting barge chief .
he hauled himself laboriously out of the water , his heavy cylinders causing him momentarily to lose balance , but a heave from above landed him safe and sound on the deck .
his dripping shape was quickly surrounded by other members of the team who had been waiting on the dive platform .
Jack Howard made his way down from the bridge walkway and smiled at his friend .
he still found it amazing that such a bulky figure could be so agile underwater .
as he negotiated the clutter of dive equipment on the aft deck he called out , his mocking tone a familiar part of their banter over the years .
“ We thought you &apos;d swum back to Athens for a gin and tonic beside your father &apos;s pool . ”
this study is not based on bulletproof quantitative data , guesswork or personal opinions , but on a combination of many things , including interviews , general studies , general trends and anecdotal evidence .
the graphs covering the period before 1990 are all based on interviews and many Google searches to learn about the history of newspapers , TV and radio — and more specifically , which methods of information gathering people used in the past .
the graphs covering the period from 1998 and up to today are based on all the things that have happened in the past 11 years , concerning which I have probably seen 1000 surveys .
the graph for 2009 and forward is based on what I , and many other people , predict will happen in the years to come .
the graphs are not intended to be 100 % accurate , but rather to give an idea of the changing landscape , and to prepare for the future of social news , targeted information and the like .
the purpose of the article is to push people forward .
we are seeing an entirely new way for people to interact ; one that makes all traditional ways seem trivial .
it is a fundamental shift that will completely change the world as we know it .
the best thing about it is that you will be able to help make it happen .
so join me on this tour of the last 210 years of information sources plus a glimpse ten years ahead .
before we start to explore the future , let &apos;s see how we reached the present . we &apos;ll begin by going back to 1800 — when finding out information was very different .
in the 1800s , the only way you could really interact with other people was to go out and meet them .
it was all about face-to-face communication .
to sell a product , you would go to the local marketplace and , in general , the only way to interact was to meet in person or to set up a stall .
this meant for you to receive information — or to give it — you had to be at the right place at the right time .
you wouldn &apos;t know what was happening in another part of the city , nor could you sell your products to people in other places .
there was some talk of a novel concept called a newspaper ...
by the year 1900 , newspapers and magazines had revolutionised how we communicated , allowing us to get news from places where we had never been .
we could communicate our ideas to people we had never seen and sell our products to others far away .
you still had to go out to talk other people , but you could stay on top of things without leaving your own city .
it was amazing ; the first real information revolution .
the world was opening up to everyone .
from the 1920s on a new source of information caught people &apos;s attention — the radio .
suddenly you could listen to another person &apos;s voice hundreds of miles away .
but most importantly , you could get the latest information live .
it was another tremendous evolutionary step in the history of information .
however , radio &apos;s development time meant that newspapers still dominated our lives in the years preceding the 1960s .
if you wanted to get the latest news , or to tell people about your product , you would turn to the newspapers .
it seemed as if they would surely be the dominant source of information for ever more .
this situation began to change in the 1960s .
radio had caught on , and the two dominant sources of information were live news from the radio and the more detailed news via newspapers and magazines .
it was a great time for the media , although some said that “ the way for newspapers to meet the competition of radio is simply to produce better papers ” , an argument that we would hear repeatedly for the next 50 years .
during the next 40 years the next technical revolution , television , was introduced .
it began to gain public interest in the 1950s , and by the early 1990s its presence was huge , effectively surpassing newspapers and magazines whilst dominating the radio .
now people could both hear and see information .
the 1970s – 1990s was also the time when newspaper executives realised that something was going terribly wrong with their market .
they had had many problems in competing with radio , but television was in a different league again .
only eight years later and television ruled the information world , radio had been almost reduced to “ a place where you can listen to free music ” , and newspapers were doing everything they could to stay relevant .
the constant evolution of technology ploughed ahead with never-beforeseen determination .
a new phenomenon loomed in the shadows : the internet .
1998 was the year when the internet changed from being a geeky place that had little relevance to being arguably essential , with an “ every company needs to have a website ” philosophy .
the revolution had started three years earlier , but in 1998 it reached critical mass and caught everyone &apos;s attention , even if it was relatively little used and most people did not have access to it .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future ; the dawn of a new era .
it was a place where anyone could get information from anywhere — at least in theory .
people also started to realise that the internet was more than just information .
you could give something back by joining the conversation and being a part of the experience instead of just a spectator .
most importantly , you could choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it .
the possibilities of the internet were mind-boggling .
in 2004 , only six years later , and the internet had revolutionised how we approached information .
television and newspapers still dominated our news sources , but the new world was definitely online .
people were making new websites and exploring the world of web applications .
people could do such an incredible amount and participate in so many areas that a new concept appeared : information overload .
for the first time in our lives we were being exposed to more information than we could consume .
in the age of newspapers we had to choose what we wanted to see .
in 2004 we had to choose what we didn &apos;t want to see .
this had a devastating effect on the traditional forms of information .
in the past you could get people &apos;s attention simply by making something .
people wanted more choice , so you simply had to give them another option .
in 2004 this changed , as it was not enough to make something different ; it had to be better .
2004 was also year when another new phenomenon started to take off : social networking .
the concept had been slowly gaining ground with the concept of blogs .
they were an easy , simple and affordable way for everyone to share their ideas .
for the first time , anyone could create their own sphere of information without doing anything “ technical ” .
handling information changed from being a tool for the professionals to a tool for anyone .
three years later and the social element of the internet showed just how powerful the voice of the people really is .
for the first time television was no longer the primary source of information , and news-papers were struggling to survive .
everyone wanted to create their own little world , and connect it to their friends .
2007 was also the turning point for traditional websites , with people comparing them to newspapers — a static and passive form of information .
we wanted active information .
we wanted to be a part of it , not just to look at it .
blogs started to get into trouble .
just as television had eliminated radio ( because it was a better and richer way to give people live information ) , so were social networks eliminating blogs .
a social profile is a more active way for people to share what they care about .
social networks are simply the best tool for the job , and blogs could not keep up .
two years later , today , the new internet dominates our world completely .
newspapers are dead in the water , and people are watching less television than ever .
we are the new kings of information , using social networking tools to connect and communicate .
even the traditional website is dying , killed by the relentless force of constant streaming information from social networks .
in the past 210 years we have seen an amazing evolution in how we obtain information .
the principal forward steps are :
1 . getting information from distant places .
2 . getting it live .
3 . seeing it live .
4 . deciding when to see something , and what to see .
5 . being able to take part and comment .
6 . publishing our own information .
7 . being the source of information .
2009 will be the start of the next revolution .
everything we know is about to change .
the first and most dramatic change is the concept of social news .
this is quickly taking over our need to stay up to date with what goes on in the world .
news is no longer being reported by journalists , as now it comes from anyone and everyone .
it is being reported directly from the source to you — bypassing the traditional media channels .
instead of having a journalist report what analysts are saying , you hear it from the analyst herself .
social news is getting news from the source , directly and unfiltered .
a new wave of entertainment is emerging ( the light blue and purple areas on the graph ) , one dominated by the games , video and audio streams .
instead of tuning into a television channel , you decide what to see and when to see it .
we no longer subscribe to channels where someone else decides what you can see .
you control everything about the experience .
a new concept in the form of targeted information is slowly emerging .
we are already seeing an increasing number of services on mobile phones that provide local information for the area that you are in .
for example , instead of showing all the restaurants in the world , the phone will only show a list of those in your area .
this is something that will explode in the years to come .
in a world where we have access to more information that we can consume , getting the relevant information is going to be a very important element , expanding far beyond the simple geo-targeting that we see today .
over the next five to ten years , the world of information will change .
all the traditional forms will essentially die .
printed newspapers will no longer exist , television in the form of preset channels will be replaced by single shows that you can watch whenever you like .
radio shows are destined to be replaced with podcasts and vodcasts .
websites will have a much smaller role , as their primary function will be to serve as a hub for all the activities that you do elsewhere , becoming the place where people get the raw material for use in other places .
many websites and social networks will merge into one .
social news , as described previously , is going to be the main way that people communicate .
traditional journalism will be completely superseded as people get information directly from the source .
everyone is a potential reporter , but new advances in targeting will eliminate most of the noise .
journalists will become editors who , instead of reporting the news , will bring it together to give us a bigger picture .
the news stream of the future will be personalised , and will constantly at just what you see — much in the same way as Last.fm is doing today with music .
everything will incorporate some form of targeting .
you will be in control over every single bit of information that flows your way .
in 2010 , two new concepts will start to emerge .
one of them is intelligent information , where information streams can combine pieces from many different news sources , not just by pulling data , but by summarising it , breaking it apart and extracting the valuable parts .
instead of reading five different articles on the same topic , you will be presented with one , highlighting the vital points of interest .
how safe are your Christmas lights ?
EU testing shows serious risk of shocks and fire in many lights .
stay safe – turn them off when you go to bed or leave the house .
one in three sets of Christmas lights tested in a commission-led market survey presented a direct risk of fire or electric shock .
tests were carried out in Germany , Hungary , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia on nearly 200 sets of light strings in all price categories .
the samples were checked against over 20 requirements , and many failed more than one test .
the commission found thin wiring , weak cord anchorage and poor insulation in many strings of lights .
just over 40 % of the samples were made in China .
in Hungary , nearly 96 % of the lights were found to be hazardous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % failed to comply with EU safety standards .
although only five countries took part in the survey , it is likely the same lights are being sold across the EU .
consumer commissioner Meglena Kuneva said the findings were a wake-up call .
she urged EU member countries to do a better job of enforcing safety standards and said industry – manufacturers , retailers , distributors and importers – should also step up their checks .
as for consumers , she stressed vigilance , offering the following advice : 1. buy Christmas lights from reputable dealers 2. never leave Christmas lights on when you are out of the house or in bed 3. if you suspect a problem with your lights , stop using them and return them to the shop .
some 4,000 participants from 1,500 organisations are expected to attend a Stockholm event showcasing EU efforts to boost development .
under the overarching theme of ‘ citizens and development ’ , this year &apos;s event will focus on the effects of global warming and the recession on poorer countries .
although they are usually least to blame , these countries are particularly hard hit by both the economic downturn and climate change .
rising sea levels , desertification and more frequent and severe natural disasters could push millions into poverty and undo past progress on the millennium development goals .
and the current economic climate has lead to a reduction in aid donations to developing countries , reducing food security in already vulnerable regions .
by bringing together politicians , civil servants , NGOs , business leaders , academics , researchers and the media , the European Development Days provide an opportunity for networking , sharing experiences and finding new partners for development projects .
the three-day event , starting on 22 October , includes training , discussion forums and workshops .
a development ‘ village ’ gives organisations the chance to present themselves to delegates and the public , and to raise awareness of their aims .
several development-related prizes will be awarded , including the Lorenzo Natali journalism prize for excellence in reporting on human rights , democracy and development issues .
the development youth prize goes to teenagers for posters or videos showing human development in Africa .
on 22 October , the EU will also publish the first-ever European development report .
it will form a basis for discussions on the EU &apos;s approach to ‘ fragile ’ countries in sub-Saharan Africa .
the EU provides more than half of all development aid .
donor conference sends strong signal of support for Georgia .
until recently Georgia had one of the world &apos;s fastest-growing economies – 12 % growth in 2007 .
that changed during the brief but intense conflict with Russia in August .
key transport routes and utility lines were damaged , buildings and houses reduced to rubble and huge swathes of forest destroyed by bombs .
more than two months later , many foreign investors have taken flight , tourists have disappeared , unemployment has risen and many Georgians have emptied their bank accounts .
the World Bank now estimates that Georgia , a gateway for energy resources to Europe , needs € 2.4bn to recover .
the EU has committed € 500m over the next three years and the US has pledged € 757m ( $ 1bn ) , more than half of it by the end of this year .
the EU and the World Bank hosted a donor conference on 22 October , to bring in the remaining € 1.1bn.
nearly 70 countries and institutions were invited to the event .
the aid will support reconstruction and help the Georgian government meet the immediate needs of people who had to flee their homes .
tens of thousands of people were uprooted , many of whom are still sheltering in makeshift refugee centres .
but the long-term objective is to revive Georgia &apos;s economy , which has undergone considerable reform in recent years .
“ It is essential that the crisis should not distract Georgia from the political and economic reform efforts that are , if anything , more important now than before this summer &apos;s conflict , ” external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said .
the former Soviet republic normally receives about € 40m a year from the EU .
Georgia and Russia remain at odds over South Ossetia and Abkhazia , two breakaway Georgian provinces that Russia recognises as independent countries .
the two sides held a first round of peace talks in Geneva on 15 October , and negotiations are to resume in November under the auspices of UN and European mediators .
this allowed EU observers to move into those zones to monitor the ceasefire .
thousands of Russian troops remain in the separatist regions .
European musicians honoured for best-selling debut albums .
ten new stars will share the limelight at this year &apos;s European Border Breakers awards .
recognising success in reaching a wider audience , the European awards go to musicians with the best-selling debut albums in the EU , not including their home country .

2008 Cannes festival shows ever-growing success of EU-funded films worldwide .
fourteen films jointly funded by the EU media programme have been selected to appear at the 61st Cannes international film festival .
EU-funded productions are no strangers to film festivals and over the years have been seen by millions of people .
the EU media programme funds European audiovisual projects , promoting the continent &apos;s cultural diversity through film .
however , European film makers face major challenges both internationally and at home .
on 19 May , during the sixth “ Europe day ” at Cannes , EU representatives will sit down with European film ministers and producers to discuss how to stimulate more international cooperation in the audiovisual industry .
the aim is to expand the circulation of content to other parts of the world and work more closely with film industries outside the EU .
such international partnerships would further aid the production and distribution of European films .
last year &apos;s selection for the Cannes festival included eleven films funded by the EU media programme .
and earlier this year a string of EU-backed films - such as The counterfeiters and La Môme – were garlanded at the Oscars .
the 14 EU-funded films at Cannes 2008 are : Gomorra , Delta , La frontière de l &apos;Aube , Le silence de Lorna , The Palermo Shooting , sangue pazzo , Entre les murs , Tulpan , Eldorado , Elève libre , Salamandra , Les bureaux de Dieu , Better things and Home .
climate change , the financial crisis and economic relations dominated the EU-China summit in Prague on 20 May .
the EU and China signed agreements to expand cooperation in science and technology , clean energy and small business .
and they reaffirmed their commitment to a project to showcase technology for generating electricity from coal without releasing CO2 - one of the main gases behind global warming .
the two sides also explored positions ahead of the international talks on climate change in Copenhagen in December .
the EU is urging emerging economies like China to limit CO2 emissions in exchange for financial support from developed nations .
on the financial crisis , the EU and China agree that international institutions should have a bigger role in monitoring economic risks and that the emerging and developing economies should have more say in these institutions .
at high-level talks earlier in May , the two sides emphasised trade and investment as key to economic recovery .
the two sides also discussed human rights in Tibet and conflicts in Sri Lanka , Afghanistan and Pakistan – three countries where China wields considerable influence .
on Tuesday , December 15 , Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis sent a letter of condolences to the Prime Minister of Estonia Andrus Ansip , expressing condolences to the people of Estonia and the Prime Minister of Estonia on the occasion of death of Estonian soldier in Afghanistan .
in his letter of condolences , the Prime Minister emphasizes that death of the soldier is great loss to the family of the victim and whole Estonia .
today , Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and Minister for Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs held a meeting with Minister for Agriculture of Estonia Helir – Valdor Seeder , Minister for Agriculture of Lithuania Kazys Starkevičius and Minister for Agriculture and Food of Belarus Semyon Shapiro to discuss future trends of cooperation in agriculture .
the Minister for Agriculture of Latvia Jānis Dūklavs informed about the four countries &apos; Memorandum that was signed today and provides for more favorable conditions for cooperation in agriculture between the countries .
it will be based on equality and mutual benefit , by aligning the legislation and through the exchange of information and practical projects .
the Prime Minister emphasized : “ The Memorandum that was signed today will promote the cooperation in a very substantial sector of national economy for all four countries - agriculture ” .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food of Belarus Semyon Shapiro thanked the Minister for Agriculture of Latvia Jānis Dūklavs for the initiative , which was expressed during his visit to Minsk , to bring together the Ministers for Agriculture of three Baltic countries and Belarus not only to discuss the issues and current events of the sector , but also to outline certain tasks to be performed in the future .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food of Belarus noted that Belarus has the practical experience in production of full range of agricultural machinery and it would be interested in creating joint enterprises with Latvia .
Minister Shapiro called on to help the professionals in agriculture of Latvia and other Baltic countries , to provide practical experience in the area of certification of agricultural product processing companies and companies producing agricultural machinery in order to ensure sales opportunities for agricultural products of Belarus in the EU market .
the Minister for Agriculture of Lithuania Kazys Starkevičius expressed his gratitude for active mutual cooperation in agriculture and fisheries in the European Union in Brussels among the three Baltic countries , Finland and Poland , but today a new model of cooperation among the three Baltic countries and Belarus was activated .
the Minister for Agriculture of Estonia Helir – Valdor Seeder stressed that currently there is an active cooperation with Latvia in the area of agriculture , which has a tendency to increase .
the minister also informed that there are three main priorities in the next year &apos;s budget of Estonia , one of them being agriculture .
on Wednesday , December 9 , in Bonn , Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis received the sme Union Political Entrepreneurship Award of the European People &apos;s Party for promotion of entrepreneurship policy .
the award was handed over by the President of the sme Union Peter jungen , who emphasized that the main objective of the award is to shape the EU policy in a more sme friendly way .
the Prime Minister of Latvia thanked the sme Union for appreciation and contribution to the development of investment-friendly and efficient business environment in Europe .
V.Dombrovskis stressed that the sme Union network has contributed to the idea on implementation of support measures for micro-enterprises in Latvia .
the Latvian government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability , but has also developed a support program for micro-enterprises in Latvia aimed at reducing barriers to micro-enterprise activities and encouraging the people who are out of work to start their own business .
to achieve the objective , the Government has adopted a decision on the reduced requirements for company &apos;s share capital and the cost of registration , simplified procedures for tax reporting and accounting , and has granted financial support for micro-enterprise activities .
in his speech , the Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-size enterprises are the driving force for the economy , contributing to reduction of unemployment , long-term development and stability .
we have already informed that from December 8-10 Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis participates in the European People &apos;s Party Congress in Bonn , Germany .
the Reform Management Group has agreed on a joint communication that will be signed already on Monday , November 2 . the communication presents the assessment of the current work of the group and outlines the main tasks to be accomplished within the framework of structural reforms .
the communication recognizes the cooperation model established by the government and non-governmental organizations , which represents the joint responsibility for the socio-economic situation in the country , the international obligations of Latvia and their impact on future developments .
the Reform Management Group has assigned a priority to those tasks which directly focus on national competitiveness , growth and recovery of economy .
the Group emphasizes that by the joint assessment of the state functions to be performed and rational use of potential state budget resources the progress has been made in determining the reduction of funds pursuant to the results of task and function assessment aiming to stop the linear fund cutting .
although an agreement was reached on the objectives – small and efficient administration , expansion of internal and external market for the economy of Latvia and promotion of the employment , the members of the group share the common opinion on the need to continue the work on defining a clear framework for future structural reforms .
the Reform Management Group believes that it is necessary to continue to actively implement the social security measures , the measures included in the economic recovery plan aimed at entrepreneurship promotion and investment attraction , the measures in support to micro-enterprise activities and business start-ups , in-depth examination of the public administration functions , streamlining the evaluation methodology and introduction of a one-stop-shop principle in service provision .
the Reform Management Group has agreed on the necessity to speed up the implementation of the EU programs which were delayed in the current period and reach the five years &apos; amount in two years &apos; time . the Group also considers that the medium-term budget should be implemented by dividing the budget into operative and development budget linking the restoration of the internal market with future development priorities , attractive investment climate for domestic and foreign capital , by reducing taxes and introducing other comparative advantages .
the Reform Management Group was established in July , 2009 with the aim to ensure the public participation in the budget drafting and decision-making .
on November 26 and 27 an international conference “ Unregistered partnerships in the European Union ” was held in Riga .
Latvia and Estonia agree on joint renting of premises for diplomatic representations in Arab Republic of Egypt .
from 1 January 2010 onwards , the representations of Latvia and Estonia in the Arab Republic of Egypt will work in jointly rented facilities , thus optimising their administrative costs .
the agreement to this effect was reached between Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins and the Foreign Minister of Estonia Urmas Paet during his official visit to Riga on 18 February this year , and finalised in the following consultations between the Foreign Ministries .
this initiative is a prime example for the Baltic states co-operation in the implementation of similar projects also in future , in view of the chairmanship of the Baltic Council of Ministers that Latvia is to assume in 2010 .
the Embassy of Latvia in Kairo has been operational since 2007 ; it was officially opened in March 2009 during the visit to Egypt by Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins .
from 2010 onwards , the representation of Estonia in Egypt will also start its work in premises rented jointly with Latvia .
Latvia is represented in the Arab Republic of Egypt by Ambassador Maris Selga .
foreign Minister Maris Riekstins in telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister invites to seek speedy solution to cargo carriers &apos; situation on Latvia-Russia border .
on 25 December a telephone conversation took place between Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins and the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation , Sergey Lavrov . both parties discussed the results of the relations between the countries in 2009 as well as current developments in the situation with cargo carriers on the Latvia-Russia border .
both foreign ministers shared the opinion that , on the whole , the dynamics of bilateral relations this year was to be rated positively .
next , the ministers reviewed the agenda for Latvia-Russia relations in the coming year , including further enhancement of the legal framework , i.e. several significant intergovernmental agreements have been prepared for signing .
ministers Riekstins and Lavrov discussed also the current situation concerning cargo carriers on the border of Latvia and Russia .
due to the enhanced customs control by the Russian Federation the situation on the Latvia-Russia border is dramatic , and a speedy solution is required to eliminate the long lines of trucks on the Latvian side of the border crossing points , which is causing significant losses , Foreign Minister Riekstins noted in the telephone conversation .
the ministers agreed that the relevant institutions of both countries , including Latvia &apos;s Road Transport Association Latvijas Auto , should continue their efforts to normalise the situation in the nearest future according to the agreement achieved on 18 December during the Intergovernmental Commission &apos;s Transport Working Group .

we would be honored by your attendance .
please reply by Monday the 26th of February to confirm your attendance .
we look forward to seeing you there ,

in 2007 , the most powerful particle accelerator ever built , CERN &apos;s new Large Hadron Collider , will probe the secrets of matter in the energy states prevailing in the moments after the Big Bang .
by colliding particles together when they are moving at close to the speed of light , physicists hope to find out about matter in its earliest forms , using the energy produced by the collisions .
what is expected from the enormous investment made by Europe in the production of the LHC ?
it will throw two beams of protons , particles forming part of the atomic nucleus and belonging to the hadron family , in opposite directions round a circular underground tunnel of 27 km circumference beneath Switzerland and France .
intensive magnetic fields are required to accelerate the protons and make sure they are enclosed in narrow beams . these fields will be produced by superconductors , materials that are able to conduct electricity with neither resistance nor energy loss and which function at very low temperatures , developed in collaboration with European industry .
collisions between protons occur at a rate of eight hundred million times per second at a colossal energy of 14 TeV .
to understand the magnitude of this number , 1 TeV is the approximate amount of energy used for motion … by a mosquito in flight .
in the LHC , however , this energy will be concentrated in an area one million million times smaller than the insect .
since the energy can be converted to particles in accordance with the principle of mass / energy equivalence in restricted relativity – the famous E = mc2 – physicists hope to create particles that have never before been observed in accelerators .
the density and intensity of the collisions are important , as they multiply the chances of seeing the appearance of the particles .
two beams of lead nuclei will also be produced , reaching energies of 1 150 TeVs , but with fewer collisions per second .
from the search for supersymmetry …
certain detectors will be capable of collision analysis .
two of them are called CMS ( Compact Muon solenoid ) and Atlas ( A Toroidal LHC Apparatus ) .
they will concentrate on the detection of supersymmetric particles and Higgs bosons .
what about supersymmetry ?
particle physics consists of numerous symmetries – for example , matter and antimatter .
supersymmetry associates a fermion ( building blocks of matter like electrons and quarks ) to each Boson ( directing transmission of interactions like the photon ) and vice versa .
the challenge is that the antiparticles termed supersymmetric ( also designated sparticles ) have never before been observed .
how to detect them ?
paradoxically , by their absence !
“ It &apos;s a little like being at the cinema .
you count the number and type of people who enter and those that leave .
if a person is missing at the end , then because you know who entered you can make a guess at who did not exit . ”
in the same way , LHC testers know that certain collisions are supposed to produce these sparticles , which are invisible to all detectors .
knowing the energies of the particles prior to collision , they will be compared to the energies of the particles produced after the collisions .
if there is any difference in energy , then a particle has escaped .
by calculating the missing energy , they will know if a supersymmetric component or sparticle is involved .
the other challenge for the CMS and LHS detectors is to detect the Higgs Boson .
the focal point of the standard model theory , this is supposed to interact with the particles and give them mass .
how ?
let &apos;s consider a room full of physics students .
suddenly , Albert Einstein enters the room and the students surround him and press him with their questions .
Albert , then , in his attempts to move , feels a certain inertia due to the students that are clinging to him .
he is similar to these particles when Higgs bosons try to interact with them – they gain mass .
here too , the much anticipated detection of these famous bosons can only be indirect : the particles that result from their disintegration are the ones that will be detected .
the quark-gluon soup
the third detector with which the LHC is equipped is named Alice ( A Large Ion Collider Experiment ) .
its purpose is to explore the unknown sections of nuclear physics , especially a state of matter that existed a very short time after the Big Bang known as quark-gluon plasma .
what is this new oddity ?
in the 1960s , scientists realised that the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus of atoms , were themselves made up of more basic particles , quarks .
these quarks are linked to each other by strong forces , themselves directed by particles known as Gluons .
one of their characteristics is that they are gregarious : they always go in pairs or in threes ; they cannot exist by themselves .
the more you try to separate a quark from another quark , the greater the cohesive force that binds them together , making them permanently inseparable .
quarks are said to be confined .
however , if protons are bombarded against each other at high energies , a soup is created containing quarks and Gluons in which the quarks will be free to move .
we can then refer to the deconfining of the quarks in the quark-gluon plasma .
why this deconfining ?
“ It is a little comparable to skiing .
when there isn &apos;t much snow , the tracks can be separated by grassy zones and the skiers are confined on their tracks .
on the other hand , if there is a lot of snow , they can change tracks .
they are deconfined . ”
rather than snow , physicists will add energy : the greater the quark energy , the weaker their cohesive forces , so above a certain energy threshold , they can be separated .
this quark-gluon plasma state was probably the state of matter a few microseconds after the Big Bang .
that is why physicists wish to study it with the help of lead-ion beams produced by the LHC .
these are , in effect , very rich in protons and neutrons .
they can attain an energy of 1,150 TeV which is required to produce and study the quark-gluon plasma present at the beginning of the universe with unprecedented precision .
the mystery of antimatter
finally , the last detector , named LHCb , the Large Hadron Collider beauty .
its goal is to better observe the subtle differences between matter and antimatter in order to better understand what happened to the Universe &apos;s antimatter .
for each particle , there is an antiparticle that has , among other properties , the same mass but an opposite charge. the same mass but an opposite charge .
therefore , for the negatively charged electron , there is a corresponding antielectron ( or positron ) of equal mass but with a positive charge .
when an electron and an antielectron meet , they annihilate each other , producing a burst of energy .
according to the standard model of particle physics , equal amounts of matter and antimatter must have been created at the beginning of the universe .
consequently , all particles should have cancelled each other out and the universe should be empty .
however , as anyone can see , matter is abundant .
this is where the question arises that the LHCb will attempt to answer : where , then , is antimatter ?
one possible answer is based on the ability of certain particles to transform themselves into their antiparticles and vice versa .
in this case , the existence of matter depends on the hypothesis – yet to be proven – that the transformation of antiparticles into particles is dependent upon the opposite transformation at the beginning of the universe .
can such disequilibrium be demonstrated ?
it has actually been seen experimentally with quark-type particles called kaons .
Antikaons spontaneously transform into kaons but the opposite occurs less often .
the LHCb will study another candidate , meson B , which contains ( among other things ) , an elementary particle ( or its antiparticle ) called quark b , or beauty ( from whence the charming name of the LCHb ) .
though particles cannot be seen , it is possible to detect them .
to do this , the LHC is equipped with devices consisting of several concentric layers which , like an onion , surround the particle beam where the collisions occur .
each layer specialises in one particular type of detection .
at the centre of the detector , there is a track chamber . inside this chamber , there are millions of semiconductors that produce an electric pulse when touched by a particle .
these pulses are recorded by computers . this makes it possible to reconstruct their trajectories .
there is also a magnetic field inside each detector .
this helps detect and study the trajectories of the charged particles , such as the electron or the proton , which are sensitive to the magnetic field .
another device is a calorimeter-bearing track detector .
some calorimeters stop particles like photons or electrons , while some are designed to stop neutrons and photons .
they measure the energy lost by the particles that penetrate them .
help from the strings
how can the nature of basic particles be defined beyond the mechanisms presiding over their creation ?
besides the standard model of particle physics – resulting from the postulations of quantum mechanics – contemporary science has pinned its hopes on the totally new unifying notion provided by the highly mathematical string theory .
this introduces the prospect of totally new kinds of experiments at CERN .
the standard model – the keystone of modern physics , painstakingly put in place during the 20th century – considers elementary particles to be points governed by three of the fundamental interactions recognised between the particles : electromagnetism , and the strong and weak forces .
this allows us to offer a description that fits very well with what happens in this world of the infinitely small .
this model , however , does not take into account the fourth interaction - gravity .
now , in quantum physics , just as light propagates itself with the help of a particle , the photon , gravitational interaction must be transmitted with the help of another particle , the graviton .
in search of unification
there is an obstacle , therefore , to the description of such a particle by the standard model ( see box ) .
moreover , at the beginning , the Universe was both extremely small and extremely massive ( all energy and matter were concentrated into a very small volume ) .
consequently , there too , a theory to describe the particles that predominated during that period cannot leave gravity aside .
how , then , to integrate into all this the theory of general relativity – proposed by Einstein at the beginning of the last century – which revolves entirely around gravitation ?
“ The unification of quantum mechanics and the theory of general relativity has become the real Holy Grail for physicists .
armies of scientists are working on the issue .
the most promising path seems to be string theory . ”
from points to strings
what does this theory tell us about our world ?
first , it views particles not as points but as elements that can be compared to extremely small strings , in the order of 10-35 meters long ( 1 preceded by 35 zeroes , the first being to the left of the decimal point ) .
these strings vibrate and the manner in which they vibrate corresponds to different types of particle .
the more a string vibrates , the more energetic its corresponding particle .
one of the properties of string theory that is necessary for its mathematic consistency is supersymmetry .
to understand what this is , a short explanation of the ‘ zoology ’ of elementary particles is needed .
quantum bodies in the universe can be divided into two families : on the one hand , there are the fermions which include electrons and quarks ; on the other , there is the family known as bosons , which include the mediating particles of fundamental interactions such as the photon , which directs electro - magnetic forces , and the graviton , mentioned above , for gravitation .
the supersymmetry issue
supersymmetry consists of the supposition that each particle in the fermion family corresponds to a particle belonging to the Boson family , and vice versa , hence the idea of symmetry .
no supersymmetric particle has yet been discovered , but particle physicists hope to see them in high-energy collisions , which they will soon produce using the LHC , the new particle accelerator at CERN .
in the meantime , astronomers might indirectly observe the effects of these mysterious particles , since the total mass of the galaxies and galaxy clusters seems much greater than the luminous mass ( stars , gas , etc ) detected by astronomers &apos; telescopes .
they therefore postulate the existence of an invisible dark matter that only interacts with the rest of matter by its gravitation , and consists of very stable , and therefore very light , particles .
there are many features shared with the lightest of supersymmetric particles .
these could , therefore , be the unknown constituents of dark matter , the effects of which were first observed by the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky in 1933 .
four interactions , from one single interaction
another question puzzling scientists concerns nature &apos;s four famous fundamental interactions .
why are their strengths so different from each other ?
the strength of gravitational interaction is , for example , much weaker than that of electromagnetic interaction .
proof of this is that the magnetism from a single magnet is sufficient to pull a relatively large metallic mass while an entire planet is required to move the same mass using gravity .
one answer to this question is that all fundamental interactions were just one interaction at the extremely high energies which prevailed at the beginning of the universe .
